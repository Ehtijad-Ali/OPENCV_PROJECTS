# Smile_Detection_using_openCV
This project is a real-time facial recognition and smile detection system using OpenCV. It leverages Haar cascades to identify faces and smiles from a live video feed captured through a webcam. The program first detects faces in the video stream, then isolates the region of interest (ROI) around the detected face to further identify smiles within that region.
